This is a basic traffic light system that uses LEDs and an ATmega328 microcontroller. This initiative makes it easier for pedestrians to safely cross the road. Even if we construct the most complex traffic signal system, it is ultimately our responsibility to follow all traffic laws and regulations. We don't need superior technology to follow the rules if we follow the rules.
