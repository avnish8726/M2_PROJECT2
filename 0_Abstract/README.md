# ⁂ Introduction ⁂
Personal automobiles are increasingly popular, and as a result, the number of vehicles on the road is rapidly expanding. Traffic congestion and accidents can occur on roads that are not supervised or guided.


Traffic lights, often known as traffic signals, are signalling devices that are used to regulate traffic flow. They are usually seen at intersections, 'X' roads, pedestrian crossings, and other locations where they alternate who has to wait and who has to go.
This is a basic project that aids in traffic signal regulation and allows ordinary people to cross the road with ease.


# ⁂ Features ⁂
The system is based on ATMEGA 328 and is simple, low-cost, and real-time traffic signal system that attempts to overcome numerous challenges and improve the traffic system..
